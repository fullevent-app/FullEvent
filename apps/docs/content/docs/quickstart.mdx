Welcome to FullEvent! This guide will help you set up your first project and start ingesting events.

## 1. Create a Project

First, head over to your [FullEvent Dashboard](http://localhost:3000) and create a new project. Give it a name that describes your application or service.

## 2. Generate an API Key

Once your project is created, navigate to the **Settings** or **Project** page to generate a new API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep your API key secret. Do not share it or expose it in client-side code.

## 3. Install the SDK

Choose the SDK that fits your environment. For most Node.js applications, use the `@fullevent/node-sdk`.

```bash
pnpm add @fullevent/node-sdk
```

## 4. Send your First Event

Using the API key you generated, send a test event to confirm everything is working.

```typescript
import { FullEvent } from '@fullevent/node-sdk';

const fullevent = new FullEvent({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

await fullevent.ingest('hello_world', {
  status: 'awesome'
});
```

## 5. Verify in the Dashboard

Go back to your dashboard and select your project. You should see your `hello_world` event appearing in the **Event Logs** in real-time!
