description: Welcome to FullEvent - The Dashboard as a Service platform.
---

FullEvent is a "Dashboard as a Service" platform designed to simplify event ingestion and observability for modern web applications. 

We believe that observability should be easy, interactive, and high-fidelity. By using our "Wide Event" philosophy, we capture rich context at every step of your application's lifecycle.

## Why FullEvent?

- **Real-time Observability**: See your events as they happen with zero latency.
- **Rich Context**: Ingest complex payloads and see them formatted beautifully in our dashboard.
- **Easy Integration**: Use our light-weight SDKs for any Node.js environment.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Hono is NOT a requirement. You can use FullEvent in any JavaScript/TypeScript environment—from simple scripts to complex backend architectures.
- **Tail Sampling**: Our middleware automatically aggregates request context for you.
