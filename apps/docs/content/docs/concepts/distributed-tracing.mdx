title: Distributed Tracing
description: Connect your frontend interactions to your backend logs.
---

Distributed tracing is the "superpower" of FullEvent. It allows you to tell a complete story from the moment a user clicks a button to the final database query on your server.

## The Problem

In a typical stack, you have:
1.  **Frontend Logs**: "User clicked checkout"
2.  **Backend Logs**: "API /checkout called", "Database error"

These are usually disconnected. If a user complains "Checkout failed", you have to guess which API log matches that user's session.

## The Solution: Trace IDs

FullEvent connects these worlds using a **Trace ID**.

1.  The **React SDK** generates a unique `trace_id` when an action starts.
2.  it passes this ID to the **Backend** via a mechanism like HTTP headers.
3.  The **Node SDK** sees this ID and adopts it for its own logs.

## How to Implement

### 1. Frontend: Start the Trace
Use `createEvent` to start a wide event context and get the headers.

```tsx title="src/components/Checkout.tsx"
// Frontend (React)
const { createEvent } = useFullevent();

async function handleBuy() {
  const event = createEvent('buy.flow');
  
  await fetch('/api/buy', {
    method: 'POST',
    // ⬇️ This is the magic line
    headers: event.getHeaders() 
  });
}
```

### 2. Backend: Continue the Trace
Ensure your backend is using the `wideLogger` middleware. It automatically looks for the `x-fullevent-trace-id` header.

```typescript title="src/server.ts"
// Backend (Hono/Node)
app.use(wideLogger({ ... }));

app.post('/buy', (c) => {
  // The 'wideEvent' here AUTOMATICALLY has the same trace_id 
  // as the frontend event!
  const event = c.get('wideEvent');
  
  console.log(event.trace_id); // Matches the frontend!
  return c.json({ ok: true });
});
```

## Visualizing Traces

In the FullEvent dashboard, clicking any log that has a `trace_id` will automatically search for all other logs with that same ID. You will see a timeline view showing:

1.  **Frontend**: User Clicked Buy (0ms)
2.  **Network**: Request sending...
3.  **Backend**: API Processing started (50ms)
4.  **Backend**: Payment Charged (150ms)
5.  **Backend**: Response Sent (160ms)
