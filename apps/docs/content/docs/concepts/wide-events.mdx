description: Understand the philosophy behind FullEvent's data model.

Traditional logging often involves thousands of small, disconnected log lines. FullEvent advocates for a different approach: **Wide Events**.

## What are Wide Events?

A Wide Event is a single data structure that captures as much context as possible about a specific unit of work (like an HTTP request or a background job).

Instead of:
- `[INFO] User 123 started checkout`
- `[INFO] User 123 added item ABC`
- `[ERROR] User 123 payment failed`

A Wide Event looks like:
```json
{
  "event": "checkout_completed",
  "user_id": 123,
  "cart_value": 99.99,
  "items": ["ABC"],
  "error": "insufficient_funds",
  "duration_ms": 1450,
  "request_id": "req_5566"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **High Fidelity**: You don't lose the relationship between different signals.
2. **Interactive Exploration**: Every field is a dimension you can filter or group by in our dashboard.
3. **Reduced Noise**: One rich event is better than fifty flat log lines.

## How we capture them

FullEvent SDKs are designed to "collect" context throughout a request's lifecycle and send it all at once at the end (Tail Sampling). This ensures your dashboard shows the complete picture without you having to manually correlate logs.
